Orange Jacket Guy's epic nacho cheese sauce v0.03b

Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
7-ish slices processed American or Cheddar cheese (just use your best judgement)
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional upon compile)
1 tablespoon or more juice from Pepperoncini jar
1 diced Pepperoncini pepper or more from jar (optional upon compile)
1 tablespoon or more El Yucateco Salsa Picante de Chile Habanero (optional upon compile)
A few drops of generic BBQ sauce

Substitutions, adaptations, and improvisations upon compile
If less "spicy" sauce is required -
    Replace Pepperoncini juice with pickle juice, and eliminate diced pepper and El Yucateco
If a more "vinegar hot" over a "pepper hot" taste is required - 
    Replace El Yucateco and BBQ sauce with equivalent amount of Frank's RedHot Sauce

Directions
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter then SLOWLY sift-in flour. Pour in the milk and stir until the mixture thickens. Stirring constantly, SLOWLY mix in cheese and salt. Add more cheese to taste. When cheese is about 80% blended, SLOWLY add Pepperoncini juice and pepper, then El Yucateco sauce; continue to cook and stir until cheese has melted and all ingredients are well blended. Add BBQ sauce last. About 15 minutes.
