Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
7-ish slices processed American or Cheddar cheese (just use your best judgement)
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional upon compile)
1 tablespoon or more juice from Pepperoncini jar
1 tablespoon or more El Yucateco Salsa Picante de Chile Habanero
A few drops of generic BBQ sauce

Directions
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter then SLOWLY sift-in flour. Pour in the milk and stir until the mixture thickens. Stirring constantly, SLOWLY mix in cheese and salt. Add more cheese to taste. When cheese is about 80% blended, SLOWLY add Pepperoncini juice then El Yucateco sauce; continue to cook and stir until cheese has melted and all ingredients are well blended. Add BBQ sauce last.
